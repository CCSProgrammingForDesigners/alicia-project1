	<h2>Why they are awesome</h2>
	<p>Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. It's raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos, don't even ask why. Give me all the tacos, immediately. I've been following that taco truck around all day. It's a wonderful morning for breakfast tacos. Tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'd have to say, those tacos are on fleek. Does guac cost extra? 50 cent tacos! I'll take 30. How do you feel about hard shelled tacos? Carne asada on corn tortillas.</p>
	<p>Burritos are very tasty. Does guac cost extra? Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. TACOS!! Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! I think I've overdosed on tacos. It's taco Tuesday Monday. Fish tacos with cabbage slaw and a side of chips and guac. Tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Burritos are very tasty. 50 cent tacos! I'll take 30.</p>
	<p>CARNE ASADA!! Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat. Josh's taco shack is the best taco shack. Flour or corn tortillas? BARBACOA!! Give me tacos, or give me death. Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you have any Cholula? Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. How do you feel about hard shelled tacos? I think I've overdosed on tacos. Does guac cost extra? Give me all the tacos, immediately.</p>
